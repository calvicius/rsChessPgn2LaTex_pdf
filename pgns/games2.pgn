{My opponent is an excellent 1.e4 player, so it felt like a good decision to
try 1.d4 and at the same time avoid a possible Berlin Wall. Which had anyway
blocked me enough in this tournament.} 1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 {Inviting the
Nimzo...} d5 {...no,thanks!} 4. cxd5 exd5 {In my preparation I had anticipated
3...d5, but expected Arkady to play 4...Nxd5 here.} 5. Bg5 c6 {We ended up in
some classical Queen's Gambit. I am not revealing any big secret, if I remark
that neither of us is a big expert of it! A typical situation in modern chess!}
6. Qc2 Be7 7. e3 Nbd7 8. Bd3 Nh5 {Heading for the Carlsbad structure.} ({
Last year in the same tournament Adams played} 8... h6 9. Bh4 Nh5 10. Bxe7 Qxe7
{against me. The position is full of small nuances. It is impossible to say
what is best. In some positions Black prefers the pawn to be on h6, but
sometimes it is better to have the h7-g6 structure. It is a matter of taste or
analysis?}) 9. Bxe7 Qxe7 10. Nge2 Nhf6 {This is not very standard, 10...g6 or
10...Nb6 are played much more frequently. However I had the feeling that my
opponent did not want to touch his kingside pawns till I decided where I would
put my king.} 11. O-O Nb6 12. Rae1 {I was happy to choose this plan as I felt
that this is the most ambitious.} O-O 13. Nf4 {It took me quite some time to
decide to put my knight on f4 or to continue with the standard Nc1 plan.
Finally I convinced myself that normally White plays Nc1 because usually the
black knight is on h5 and the knight can not get to f4. In any case White
tries to prepare e3-e4 by playing f2-f3.} Bd7 $1 {A far from obvious move
played after long thought. After careful calculations Black understands what
is really going on in the position.} ({The lazy and natural} 13... g6 {could
have been answered by} 14. f3 $1 {and now after} g5 {the positional pawn
sacrifice is strong with} 15. Nfe2 $1 Qxe3+ 16. Kh1 {and White gets a very
strong attack by simply playing Nd1, Qd2, Ng3, Ne3 and the weakness of the
f5-square and Black's king vulnerability will tell.}) 14. g3 $5 {This move
might look mysterious, but in fact I think it is fairly logical. White wants
to prepare f2-f3 without allowing the annoying g5-reaction.} ({I spent a lot
of time trying to make the immediate} 14. f3 {work, but in all the lines Black
seemed to be in time} g5 $1 15. Nh3 ({The same idea as before with} 15. Nfe2
Qxe3+ 16. Kh1 {is missing a crucial tempo in the variation} Rae8 17. Nd1 Qe7
18. Qd2 h6 19. Ng3 Qd6 20. Ne3 Qf4 $1 {and Black is in time!}) (15. Qf2 {
I even considered this bullet style move} gxf4 16. exf4 Qd6 17. Qh4 Kh8 18. Re5
{looks beautiful, but after} Rg8 {soberness prevails and there is no follow-up;
Qh6 can always be met by ...Ne4!}) 15... Bxh3 16. gxh3 Kh8 17. Kh1 Rae8 18. Qf2
Nh5 {is possible but maximally double-edged. I had no intention to change the
character of the game so quickly.}) ({The other move was the immediate} 14. e4
{but unless it wins material it is better to refrain from such a move.} dxe4
15. Nxe4 Rfe8 $1 {and Black has nothing to worry about.}) 14... Qd6 {Again
best. The queen belongs here in any case, but it is not yet clear how to place
the rooks.} 15. f3 {Following the plan.} Rfc8 $2 {I was surprised by this move
and believe it to be a serious inaccuracy.} ({There was no reason why Black
should have not continued more naturally with} 15... Rac8 $1 16. g4 (16. Qf2 c5
) 16... c5 $1 {A far from obvious tactic that works with the rook on f8, but
it does not with the rook on a8!} 17. Qd2 ({The difference is in the line} 17.
dxc5 Qxc5 18. g5 d4 $1 19. gxf6 g6 $1 {and here Black is doing well! While
with the rook on a8 White has the stunning Be4 here as we will see in the
other line.}) 17... g6 {with a complex fight, but about equal chances.}) ({
It is very important to mention that the standard reaction to any f2-f3 is
usually c6-c5, but here it does not work yet because of a nice piece of
tactics.} 15... c5 $2 16. dxc5 Qxc5 17. Ncxd5 $1 {and White wins a pawn!}) 16.
g4 {I really liked my position and did not want to simplify it. The computer
likes} (16. Qf2 {more, but I do not agree} c5 17. e4 (17. dxc5 Rxc5 18. e4 dxe4
19. Nxe4 Nxe4 20. Bxe4 {also did not impress me at all}) 17... dxe4 18. Nxe4
Nxe4 19. Bxe4 Rab8 {and this is very drawish.}) 16... g6 {A necessary move.
Here the tactical solution with the immediate c6-c5 actually backfires on
Black!} (16... c5 $2 17. dxc5 (17. g5 $2 {runs into a nice refutation} cxd4 $1
18. gxf6 {and now both} g6 ({and} 18... Qxf6 {are good for black})) 17... Qxc5
(17... Rxc5 18. g5 d4 19. gxf6 dxc3 20. Bxh7+ Kf8 21. fxg7+ Kxg7 22. Be4 {
is simply good for White}) 18. g5 d4 19. gxf6 g6 {and here comes the
incredible move} 20. Be4 $3 {and White wins material} dxc3 21. Bxb7) 17. a3 {
I had the feeling that I had a very good position, but over the board it was
very difficult to understand all the finesses.} ({The text move is a good
prophylactic, but it was the right moment to play} 17. h4 $1 {I wanted to play
like this as the plan h4 followed by Qh2 was screaming to be played, but the
real point comes much later} c5 18. Qh2 cxd4 19. exd4 Qb4 {was really
bothering as there is no good way to defend the d4-pawn and it falls with
check! (The reason behind my 17.a3 move) But the engines come up with an
excellent solution to the problem, just ignore it...} 20. g5 $3 Qxd4+ 21. Kh1
Ne8 (21... Nh5 {is also bad after} 22. Nce2 Qxb2 23. Nxh5 gxh5 24. Qf4 $1 {
followed by Ng3 is very strong}) 22. h5 $1 {and suddenly at a high depth the
computer already gives an almost winning advantage for White! If you do not
believe it, please check it out!}) 17... c5 18. Qd2 {Now unfortunately I had
to lose this tempo as Qh2 is not yet available. On the other hand Black has no
way to use this tempo.} {A sad decision as after this exchange it is obvious
that White will have long lasting pressure, but it was the best option. Now
Black is fully focused on exchanging as many pieces as possible to defend the
passive position.} cxd4 19. exd4 Bc6 $1 {The key idea of Black's defence.
Defending the d5-pawn by the bishop which anyway has no other prospects.} 20.
g5 {White had a couple of interesting options, it was difficult to decide
which gives the best chances.} ({I also considered} 20. h4 Re8 21. Qh2 {
now that ...Qb4 is covered} Rxe1 {Black exchanges as much as possible} 22. Rxe1
Re8 23. Rxe8+ Nxe8 {and here} 24. Nfe2 {felt like some slight pressure, but I
wanted more.}) 20... Nfd7 21. Re2 ({As it turned out after the game} 21. h4 $1
{was strong here} Re8 22. Qh2 $1 {After all!} Nf8 23. h5 {and Black can not
exchange both rooks as the d5-pawn is hanging at the end! During the game I
had missed this small but very important detail!}) 21... Re8 22. Rfe1 Rxe2 23.
Rxe2 Nf8 24. h4 Re8 25. Rxe8 Bxe8 26. Qe3 {This was my idea and that is why I
did not play Qh2 at the end. I thought that at some point Qe5 might be a
threat.} Bc6 27. Kg2 ({The hasty} 27. Qe5 $2 {runs into} Qxe5 28. dxe5 Nfd7 {
and Black is fine.}) 27... f6 {It looks like Black has solved all his problems
and a draw is very close, but in fact the position is not that simple.} 28.
gxf6 $1 {A difficult decision, but a very good idea! At the end I felt that
this paradoxical decision gives me chances!} Qxf6 29. Kg3 {At first it looks
like there is nothing here, but if White gets Nd1-f2-g4 suddenly it looks very
unpleasant. We were down to 10 minutes each and with little time it is very
difficult to defend for Black. White's play is very easy while Black has to
take a difficult decision: to try just to sit and wait or try to do something
because there is no guarantee that by just sitting Black could hold it.} Kf7 {
A natural, good move.} ({I was hoping that my opponent would get impatient
here and go for} 29... g5 {when I considered} 30. Nh5 $5 {very dangerous for
Black} (30. hxg5 Qxg5+ 31. Kf2 Qh4+ 32. Kg1 Qg5+ 33. Kf1 {is solid and good})
30... gxh4+ 31. Kf2 Qd6 32. Qg5+ Ng6 33. f4 {and this felt very bad for Black.}
) 30. Nd1 {Following the plan.} Nbd7 {Defending such position is practically
always very difficult. With an engine's help Black could have probably saved
the game by playing ...g5 now, but it is very hard to calculate such lines.} (
30... g5 $1 31. hxg5 (31. Nh5 {This idea is again interesting} gxh4+ 32. Kf2
Qd6 33. Qg5 {looks again very promising, but with a long line the computer
holds it by some miracle} Qh2+ 34. Ke1 Nbd7 35. Ne3 Ne6 36. Qh6 Qg1+ 37. Kd2
Qg5 $1 38. Qxh7+ Ke8 {and apparently Black survives}) 31... Qxg5+ 32. Kf2 Nc4 {
I had seen this line during the game and assumed that I would be able to find
something, but not against a computer!} 33. Bxc4 dxc4 34. Nc3 {looks awful,
but Black is in time to start checking} Qh4+ 35. Ke2 Qh2+ 36. Kd1 Qh1+ {
and Black holds.}) 31. Nf2 g5 $2 {And now it is too late!} ({Black could have
exchanged some more pieces with ...Ne6, but after} 31... Ne6 32. Ng4 Qxf4+ 33.
Qxf4+ Nxf4 34. Kxf4 $14 {it is very dangerous. White has total domination
despite the little material.}) ({Best was probably to try} 31... Qe7 {when
White should keep the queens} 32. Qd2 {and the torture continues, but Black
has decent chances to survive.}) 32. hxg5 Qxg5+ 33. Kh2 Qe7 {Black's play was
based on this move,but as it turns out that the last moves only helped White.}
34. Ng4 $1 {Now I do not mind the exchange of queens!} Qxe3 35. Nxe3 {I think
Black is lost here as there is no defence against the White's king marching to
g5 when Black will end up losing a pawn sooner or later.} Nf6 36. Kg3 {The
king starts the march.} N8d7 37. Kh4 {Black has no defence. If Black tries h6
than Nf5 wins the h6-pawn right away.} Nb6 {Desperation in time trouble. Black
wants to get the knight via c8 to e7 or d6, but it is just not in time.} 38.
Kg5 Nc8 39. Ng4 $1 {Now it is over as Black loses the h7-pawn by force.} Nxg4
40. fxg4 Nd6 41. Bxh7 {The rest does not need any commentary.} Nb5 42. Ne2 Kg7
43. Bd3 Nd6 44. Kf4 Bd7 45. Nc3 Bc6 46. Nd1 Nf7 47. Ne3 Nd8 (47... Kf6 48. g5+
$1) 48. Bf5 Nf7 49. Be6 Nd6 50. Ke5 1-0

.f5, ...Rf8 and ...Nf6. My friend also added that White can spare several
tempi (four, if I counted well, although this is slightly exaggerated: With
the bishop on g7, White has to spend a tempo with g3, weakening his kingside
position at the same time) by playing the Czech Benoni: 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 c5 3.d5

obtained good results with it (each one at his own level, of course). We also
decided to call it "The Romanian Benoni", because decades ago it served Victor
